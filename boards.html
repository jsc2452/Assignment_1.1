        <h3>ADVANCING COMPUTER SCIENCE</h3> <br>
        The craft of programming transcends individual programming languages and emphasizes design across multiple scales, from 
        individual programs to complex multi-platform software architectures, including mobile platforms, multiple frameworks and 
        multiple design patterns. The Advancing Computer Science (ACS) degree balances the science of computing and the art of 
        design with the application of these principles to real-world problems. Graduates of the ACS major will be prepared for 
        software development positions where an understanding of algorithms and complex software design is important, in addition 
        to being well-versed in mobile, frameworks and multiple programming languages and environments. The Classification of 
        Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Advancing Computer Science is 11.0701.<br>
        <h3>ADVANCING COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE OBJECTIVES</h3><br>
        1. Follow a software development process to analyze a problem and to design, build and test software solutions.<br>
        2. Demonstrate software development skills using more than one programming language and development environment.<br>
        3. Implement data-driven solutions.<br>
        4. Design and implement software solutions for mobile devices, embedded systems and/or multiple platforms.<br>
        5. Document the planning and development of software applications using industry-standard tools, techniques and 
        processes.<br>
        6. Within software solutions, describe, implement and analyze data structure techniques such as lists, trees, hash tables and
        graphs, along with sorting and searching algorithms.<br>
